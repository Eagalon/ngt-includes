Follow these steps to run NGT files (`.ngt`) files using the `NGTScript` executable.

## Step 1: Copy NGT Builder to Program Files Directory

Copy the `NGT Builder` to the `Program Files directory` on your computer. Ensure that it is placed in the following location:

`C:/Program Files/ngt/NGTScript.exe`

**Important Note**

Proper placement in the `Program Files directory` is crucial for the correct functioning of the `NGT Builder`.

## Step 2: Running NGT Code

Once the `NGT Builder` is in the specified directory, you can proceed to run NGT code (`.ngt`) files.

in the `context menu`, you can `compile` or `run` `NGT scripts`.

**Reminder**

The `NGTScript executable`, located at `C:/Program Files/ngt/NGTScript.exe` is designed for running / compiling `NGT code` directly.

**Note:** If you haven't done so already, you can use the provided registry file (`ngt.reg`) to associate `NGT` files with the `NGTScript executable` for easier execution.
